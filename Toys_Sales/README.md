In this project I will perform Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset from: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?accessType=open&order=date_added%2Cdesc&tags=Retail - Mexico Maven Toys

Questions to answer:
- Which product categories generate the highest revenue and profit?
- Which store locations are the most and least profitable?
- Are there seasonal patterns in sales, such as holiday spikes?
- How do sales trends vary across different cities or regions?
- How much money is tied up in inventory, and how long will it last?
- Are sales being lost due to out-of-stock products at certain locations?
